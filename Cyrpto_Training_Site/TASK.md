# 🎯 Crypto Training Site - Task List

## 📅 Current Session Tasks

### 🔧 Alignment Improvements - Started: June 11, 2025
**Status**: In Progress
**Description**: Fix alignment issues in the subway map timeline interface to improve visual consistency and user experience.

#### Specific Alignment Issues Identified:
1. ⚠️ **Station Positioning**: Inconsistent vertical spacing between odd/even stations
2. ⚠️ **Content Panel Overlap**: Panels may overlap with adjacent stations on smaller screens  
3. ⚠️ **Connecting Lines**: Station-to-trunk connections need precise alignment
4. ⚠️ **Mobile Responsiveness**: Station layout breaks on smaller screens
5. ⚠️ **Z-index Conflicts**: Content panels may appear behind other elements

#### Sub-tasks:
- [x] Analyze current station positioning logic
- [x] Fix vertical spacing inconsistencies (standardized to ±120px)
- [x] Improve content panel positioning to prevent overlap (increased spacing)
- [x] Align connecting lines precisely with trunk (extended to 160px+ height for proper connection)
- [x] Create direct vertical connections between related stations (bottom to top pairings)
- [x] Extend connecting line heights to reach top stations (480px for full connection)
- [x] Verify z-index layering for content panels (increased to z-index: 100)
- [x] Test responsive behavior across breakpoints (mobile spacing updated)
- [x] Update content panel positions to match new station spacing
- [x] Center even stations and foundation station horizontally (translateX adjustments)
- [x] Apply consistent centering on mobile devices (smaller translateX values)
- [x] Push alignment improvements to repository (commit 7c33cc1)
- [x] Push to dedicated crypto training site repository (https://github.com/koktosen/cyrpto-training-site.git)
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify for live testing
- [ ] Final visual verification and user testing
